Examples
========

While we strive to keep the number of external dependencies required to run the examples below small (ideally: zero), many of the examples require the :py:mod:`curses` library.
On Windows, this unfortunately requires the installation of an extra module, for example `windows-curses <https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/>`_.

Device detection
----------------

This is a sample script pretty printing the audio and recording devices detected by the FMOD Engine on your system.

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/detect_devices.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

3D sound positioning
--------------------

This is a sample script demonstrating the very basics of 3D sound positioning.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/threed.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Channel groups
--------------

This is sample script showing how to put channels into channel groups.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/channel_groups.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Convolution reverb
------------------

This is a sample script showing how to set up a convolution reverb DSP and work with it.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/convolution_reverb.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

DSP effect per speaker
----------------------

This is a sample script showing how to manipulate a DSP network and as an example, creating two DSP effects, splitting a single sound into two audio paths, which then gets filtered seperately.

To only have each audio path come out of one speaker each, :py:meth:`~pyfmodex.dsp_connection.DSPConnection.set_mix_matrix` is used just before the two branches merge back together again.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/dsp_effect_per_speaker.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Effects
-------

This is a sample script showing how to apply some of the built in software effects to sounds by applying them to the master channel group. 
All software sounds played here would be filtered in the same way. 
To filter per channel, and not have other channels affected, simply aply the same function to the :py:class:`~pyfmodex.channel.Channel` instead of the :py:class:`~pyfmodex.channel_group.ChannelGroup`.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/effects.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Gapless playback
----------------

This is a sample script showing how to schedule channel playback into the future with sample accuracy. 
It uses several scheduled channels to synchronize two or more sounds.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/gapless_playback.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Generate tone
-------------

This is a sample script showing how to play generated tones using :py:meth:`~pyfmodex.system.System.play_dsp` instead of manually connecting and disconnecting DSP units.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/generate_tone.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Granular synthesis
------------------

This is a sample script showing how to play a string of sounds together without gaps, using :py:attr:`~pyfmodex.channel_control.ChannelControl.delay` to produce a granular synthesis style truck engine effect.

The basic operation is:

 #. Play two sounds initially at the same time, the first sound immediately, and the second sound with a delay calculated by the length of the first sound.
 #. Set `delay` to initiate the delayed playback. The `delay` is sample accurate and uses output samples as the time frame, not source samples.
    These samples are a fixed amount per second regardless of the source sound format, for example 48000 samples per second if FMOD is initialized to 48khz output.
 #. Output samples are calculated from source samples with a simple source-to-output sample rate conversion.
 #. When the first sound finishes, the second one should have automatically started. 
    This is a good oppurtunity to queue up the next sound. 
    Repeat step two.
 #. Make sure the framerate is high enough to queue up a new sound before the other one finishes otherwise you will get gaps.

These sounds are not limited by format, channel count or bit depth and can also be modified to allow for overlap, by reducing the `delay` from the first sound playing to the second by the overlap amount.

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/granular_synth.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Load from memory
----------------

This is a sample script showing how to use the :py:attr:`~pyfmodex.flags.MODE.OPENMEMORY` mode flag whe creating sounds to load the data into memory.

This example is simply a variant of the :ref:`play_sound` example, but it loads the data into memory and then uses the `load from memory` feature of :py:meth:`~pyfmodex.system.create_sound`.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/load_from_memory.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Multiple speakers
-----------------

This is a sample script showing how to play sounds on multiple speakers, and also how to assign sound subchannels (like in stereo sound) to different, individual speakers.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/multiple_speaker.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Multiple systems
----------------

This example shows how to play sounds on two different output devices from the same application. It creates two :py:class:`~pyfmodex.system.System` objects, selects a different sound device for each, then allows the user to play one sound on each device.

Note that sounds created on device A cannot be played on device B and vice versa.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/multiple_system.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Net stream
----------

This example shows how to play streaming audio from an Internet source.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/net_stream.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

.. _play_sound:

Play sound
----------

This example shows how to simply load and play multiple sounds, the simplest usage of FMOD. 
By default FMOD will decode the entire file into memory when it loads. 
If the sounds are big and possibly take up a lot of RAM it would be better to use the :py:attr:`~pyfmodex.flags.MODE.CREATESTREAM` flag, as this will stream the file in realtime as it plays (see :ref:`play_stream`).

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/play_sound.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

.. _play_stream:

Play stream
-----------

This example shows how to simply play a stream such as an MP3 or WAV.
The stream behaviour is achieved by specifying :py:attr:`~pyfmodex.flags.MODE.CREATESTREAM` in the call to :py:meth:`~pyfmodex.system.System.create_sound`. 
This makes FMOD decode the file in realtime as it plays, instead of loading it all at once which uses far less memory in exchange for a small runtime CPU hit.

Note that `pyfmodex` does this automatically through the convenience method :py:meth:`~pyfmodex.system.System.create_stream`.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/play_stream.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Record enumeration
------------------

This example shows how to enumerate the available recording drivers on a device. 
It demonstrates how the enumerated list changes as microphones are attached and detached. 
It also shows that you can record from multi mics at the same time (if your audio subsystem supports that).

Please note: to minimize latency, care should be taken to control the number of samples between the record position and the play position. 
Check :ref:`record` for details on this process.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/record_enumeration.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

.. _record:

Record
------

This example shows how to record continuously and play back the same data while keeping a specified latency between the two. 
This is achieved by delaying the start of playback until the specified number of milliseconds has been recorded.
At runtime the playback speed will be slightly altered to compensate for any drift in either play or record drivers.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)

.. literalinclude:: ../sample_code/record.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

User Created Sound
------------------

This example shows how create a sound with data filled by the user. 
It shows a user created static sample, followed by a user created stream. 
The former allocates all memory needed for the sound and is played back as a static sample, while the latter streams the data in chunks as it plays, using far less memory.

(Adapted from sample code shipped with FMOD Engine.)
